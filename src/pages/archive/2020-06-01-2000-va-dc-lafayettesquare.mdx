# Washington D.C., Virginia - Lafayette Square - Monday, June 1

**Rough attendance estimate**: 1000

**Notes**:
"The protesters were removed from the Lafayette Square area across from the White House, apparently to clear the way for the president to walk to St. John's Church, where he posed briefly for photographers, holding a Bible. Parts of the church compound were damaged by rioters on Sunday night." - NPR
